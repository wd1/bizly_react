## Dependencies

For consistency, please use:

`node v4.4.3`
`npm v2.8.9`

## Set up

All development is done on the dev branch

`git checkout dev`

Run `npm install` to grab all dependencies

Then run `npm run debug` to run the dev server

If you want to push and see your changes on the development site

`npm run dev-push`

This will create a production build on your local machine and push it up to the repo
Forge will then automatically run the new `dist/`
