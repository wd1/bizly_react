	      			<p ><span >Bizly, Inc. (&ldquo;Bizly,&rdquo; &ldquo;we,&rdquo; &ldquo;us&rdquo; or &ldquo;our&rdquo;) has created this mobile application, website, and web-based application at www.bizly.com (collectively, the &ldquo;Application&rdquo;) to provide individuals and businesses with a convenient forum to view information about meeting rooms and other conference space (&ldquo;Meeting Rooms&rdquo;) that are available for short term rental and the ability to reserve such Meeting Rooms.</span></p>
					<p ><span >Bizly is committed to maintaining your privacy. This privacy policy and agreement (&ldquo;Privacy Policy&rdquo;) covers how we collect, use, share and treat personal information that you may provide through our Application or while participating in the services we offer through our Application (the &ldquo;Services&rdquo;). Our Privacy Policy applies to any visitor to our website (collectively, &ldquo;you&rdquo;), including (i) casual visitors to our website who do not register to use the Application (&ldquo;Site Visitors&rdquo;), and (ii) users who have registered with Bizly to use the Application and participate in our Services (collectively, &ldquo;Registered Users&rdquo;).</span></p>
					<p ><span >&nbsp;</span></p>
					<p ><span > &bull; Your Consent. Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. Once you consent to this Privacy Policy&rsquo;s terms, it creates legal obligations on you and on Bizly. We ask you to show your consent to the terms of this Privacy Policy in different ways, depending on your relationship to the Application. The procedures for consenting to this Privacy Policy are (a) less formal if you are simply a casual Site Visitor, and (b) more formal if you are seeking to become a Registered User.</span></p>
					<p ><span > &bull; Consent by Site Visitor. By accessing and using our website as a Site Visitor, you are acknowledging that you have read and understood this Privacy Policy and agree to be legally bound by it. If you do not agree with the terms of this Privacy Policy, please refrain from using our website.</span></p>
					<p ><span > &bull; Consent by Registered Users. If you register to be a Registered User of our Application, you will be prompted to click an &ldquo;I Accept&rdquo; button linked to this Privacy Policy during the registration process. Clicking &ldquo;I Accept&rdquo; confirms your consent to the terms of this Privacy Policy.</span></p>
					<p ><span > &bull; The Types Of Information You May Provide. Information we may collect when you visit our website or register to use our Application and participate in our Services falls into three broad categories, as follows:</span></p>
					<p ><span > &bull; Personally Identifiable Information. We use the term &ldquo;Personally Identifiable Information&rdquo; to mean any information that could reasonably be used to identify you, including your name, address, email address, date of birth, financial information, or any combination of information that could be used to identify you. We collect and use Personally Identifiable Information in the manner described in Section 3 (Our Uses of Your Personally Identifiable Information). You can always decline to supply Personally Identifiable Information, with the caveat that it may prevent you from engaging in certain services.</span></p>
					<p ><span > &bull; Activities Information. We use the term &ldquo;Activities Information&rdquo; to refer to information collected by so-called &ldquo;persistent identifiers&rdquo; such as cookies and web beacons. Unlike Personally Identifiable Information, Activities Information does not directly identify a particular person; the Information, however, is or can potentially be linked to a particular computer or device. Activities Information is collected and used in the manner described in Section 4 (Our Collection and Use of Activities Information).</span></p>
					<p ><span > &bull; Aggregated Statistics. We use the term &ldquo;Aggregated Statistics&rdquo; to mean information that does not identify you and that is not linkable to a device or computer you use. Aggregated Statistics includes statistical information concerning, for example, (i) how users generally use our services, and (ii) which pages they visit most frequently. Section 5 (Our Collection and Use of Aggregated Statistics) describes our collection and use of Aggregated Statistics.</span></p>
					<p ><span > &bull; Our Uses of Your Personally Identifiable Information. We will only share Personally Identifiable Information you choose to provide to us via the Application with third parties as expressly disclosed in this Privacy Policy. We will not share it in any other way. We collect information from Site Visitors and Registered Users at different points on our website and through our Services, and use this information as follows:</span></p>
					<p ><span > &bull; Site Visitors May Only Provide Anonymous Information. As a Site Visitor, we allow you to decide whether you wish to provide us with Personally Identifiable Information. Accordingly, we have structured our website so that you may visit our site, and review selected information about our Services, without revealing your identity or providing any Personally Identifiable Information. The only information we collect from your visit will be Anonymous Information. Our obligations concerning, and permitted uses of, Anonymous Information are set out below in Section 4.</span></p>
					<p ><span > &bull;Registration Information; User Names. In order to participate in our Services as a Registered User, we require that you complete a registration form. Our registration forms will specify the information which you must provide in order to utilize our Application, which may include such items as (i) name; (ii) email and/or mailing address; (iii) phone number; and (iv) credit card information. Our registration forms may additionally request information, which you may, at your option, choose to provide or withhold. The registration process provides Registered Users with a user name and password, which allows them to gain access to the password-protected portions of the Application. This information is used by Bizly solely for internal purposes in providing the Application and related Services. The benefits of becoming a Registered User are set forth on our website and in our Terms of Use.</span></p>
					<p ><span > &bull; Protecting Your Password. It is your responsibility to keep your password private. We will treat anyone who uses your user name and password as you. Please refer to our Terms of Use regarding suggestions for protecting your password.</span></p>
					<p ><span > &bull; Reserving Meeting Rooms; Reservation Fulfillment and Payment. If you reserve a Meeting Room through our Application, we may collect Personally Identifiable Information, including contact information (such as name and email address) and financial information (such as credit card number, expiration date and security code), in connection with your Reservation of a Meeting Room. We may already have this information on file if you are a Registered User, but you will be able to update such information in connection with making a Reservation. This Personally Identifiable Information is used for billing purposes and contacting you in the event that there is an issue with your Reservation. Please note that Bizly uses a reputable third party company (the &ldquo;Payment Processing Company&rdquo;) to collect and process your payment information. Rest assured that we have taken steps to ensure that the Payment Processing Company protects Personally Identifiable Information it collects from you in compliance with our Privacy Policy.</span></p>
					<p ><span > &bull; Comments; Feedback. You may wish to provide us with comments and feedback concerning our Application. By communicating with us for these purposes, you may provide us with your email address and other Personally Identifiable Information. In these instances, we use any information you provide to us strictly for the purposes for which you submit the information.</span></p>
					<p ><span > &bull; Questionnaires and Surveys. Our Application may allow you to participate in surveys and/or questionnaires, which we may post on the Application from time to time. You are free to choose whether you participate in a survey or questionnaire. We may ask that, in addition to providing your responses, you also provide Personally Identifiable Information. In these instances, we use any information you provide to us strictly for the purposes for which you submit the information. Survey and questionnaire information may be used for the purposes of monitoring or improving the use and appeal of this Site.</span></p>
					<p ><span > &bull; Email List. You may choose to sign up for our email list, in which we send you emails with information on deals, news, and events. In addition, if you are a Registered User or have previously provided Bizly with your email address, we may choose to send news, bulletins, marketing materials, or other information, and will use Personally Identifiable Information to send such communications. If we choose to undertake such communications, you will have the ability to opt out of receiving these communications as provided in Section 8 (Changing or Removing Information; Opting Out).</span></p>
					<p ><span > &bull; Blogs, Message Boards. We may offer a blog, message board system, or review capability on our Application and you may choose to participate in an online discussion or to provide online comments. Any comments you contribute on the Application, however, become public immediately and any Personally Identifiable Information you disclose becomes available to the other users of the Application. Our Privacy Policy does not cover the information you disclose in such online discussions on our Site. You should, therefore, use discretion in what you submit to these exchanges.</span></p>
					<p ><span > &bull; Our Collection and Use of Activities Information. We and certain Vendors operating on our behalf collect Activities Information about your activity on our Site. In addition, advertisers and other third parties might collect Activities Information via our Site. The following further summarizes the Activities Information that is collected, and the purposes for which the Information is used:</span></p>
					<p ><span > &bull; IP Addresses; Logs. Bizly may automatically receive and record information in our server logs from your browser, including your IP address (the Internet address of your computer), your computer&rsquo;s name, the type and version of your web browser, referrer addresses and other generally-accepted log information. We may also record page views (hit counts) and other general statistical and tracking information, which will be aggregated with that of other users in order to understand how our Application is being used, and for security and monitoring purposes.</span></p>
					<p ><span > &bull; Cookies. A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier, which is sent to your browser from a website&rsquo;s computers and stored on your computer&rsquo;s hard drive. Cookies can be used to provide you with a tailored user experience and to make it easier for you to use a website upon a future visit. We may include cookies on our Website and use them to recognize you when you return to our Application. You may set your browser so that it does not accept cookies. Cookies must be enabled on your web browser, however, if you wish to access certain personalized features of our Services.</span></p>
					<p ><span > &bull; Tags. We may use so-called &ldquo;pixel tags&rdquo; &mdash; small graphic images (also know as &ldquo;web beacons&rdquo; or &ldquo;single-pixel GIFS&rdquo;) &mdash; to tell us what parts of our website have been visited or to measure the effectiveness of searches customers perform on our Application. Pixel tags also enable us to send email messages in a format customers can read, and they inform us whether emails have been opened, to help ensure that our messages are of interest to our customers. None of this data includes Personally Identifiable Information, and you can &ldquo;opt-out&rdquo; of receiving these types of emails from us by following the directions provided in Section 8 (Changing or Removing Information; Opting Out). If any Personally Identifiable Information is collected using such tools, it will be subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy.</span></p>
					<p ><span > &bull; Click-Throughs. We may send email messages, which use a &ldquo;click-through URL&rdquo; linked to content on our Application. When you click one of these URLs, you pass through our web server before arriving at the destination. We track this click-through data to help determine interest in particular topics and measure the effectiveness of our customer communications. If you prefer not to be tracked simply do not click text or graphic links in the email, or notify us in accordance with Section 8 (Changing or Removing Information; Opting Out).</span></p>
					<p ><span > &bull; Banner Ads; Advertising Profiles. Our Application may include the use of ad banner partners for the serving and/or targeting of ads, promotions, and other marketing messages. These ads may be provided, in some cases, by a third party ad service provider or advertiser (collectively, &ldquo;Advertisers&rdquo;). These Advertisers may use traditional banner ads, or other advertising methods, such as advertising using profiles and related content. An Advertiser may place or utilize its own cookie on your browser and may use Activities Information about your visit to our Application, such as the number of times you have viewed an ad. If the Advertiser requests that you provide Personally Identifiable Information to it, please be aware that the Advertiser&rsquo;s use and collection of this information will be governed by its privacy policy, and not our Privacy Policy. We recommend that you review the Advertiser&rsquo;s privacy policy before providing Personally Identifiable Information. You may choose not to receive targeted advertising from certain ad networks, data exchanges, marketing analytics and other service providers as indicated at: http://www.aboutads.info/choices/</span></p>
					<p ><span > &bull; Our Collection and Use of Aggregated Statistics. We use Aggregated Statistics to analyze the effectiveness of our Application, to improve our Application, products, services, and for other purposes. This information provides us with potentially useful data concerning our users&rsquo; preferences and the efficacy and interest of our Application and Services. In addition, we may undertake or commission statistical and other summary analyses of the general behavior and characteristics of Application users, and the use of our Application and related services, and may share Aggregated Statistics with third parties, including Suppliers and Advertisers (if any). Rest assured that Aggregated Statistics provided to third parties will not allow anyone to identify you. We may collect Aggregated Statistics through features of the software supporting our Application through both the means described above and other means. Any Aggregated Statistics linked with Personally Identifiable Information is protected as Personally Identifiable Information under this Privacy Policy.</span></p>
					<p ><span > &bull; We Do Not Disclose Site-Directed, Personally Identifiable Information to Unaffiliated Third Parties; Limited Exceptions. We will not disclose your Personally Identifiable Information to unaffiliated third parties without your express consent, except in the following limited circumstances:</span></p>
					<p ><span > &bull; Bizly Vendors. We may employ other companies, including Payment Processing Companies, to perform functions on our behalf, such as hosting or maintaining the Application, providing services related to the website and/or Application, collecting information, responding to and sending electronic mail, or other functions necessary to our business. We may need to share your Personally Identifiable Information with these companies (collectively, &ldquo;Vendors&rdquo;). We will provide Vendors with only that information necessary to perform their functions, and we will not allow them to use your Personally Identifiable Information for any other purpose.</span></p>
					<p ><span > &bull; Meeting Room Suppliers. If you reserve a Meeting Room through Bizly, Bizly will share information with the supplier of the Meeting Room (each, a &ldquo;Supplier&rdquo;) that the Supplier needs in order to confirm the Reservation and provide the Meeting Room and any associated services at the reserved time. In addition, if you cause damage to a Meeting Room and the Supplier informs us of such damage, we will provide the Supplier with the necessary Personally Identifiable Information, including contact and financial information, in order for the Supplier to seek reimbursement from you. We will provide the Supplier with only that Personally Identifiable Information necessary for the Supplier to provide its services to you or obtain damage-repair reimbursement (if applicable), and we will not allow the Supplier to use your Personally Identifiable Information for any other purpose. Please note that any information that you provide directly to a Supplier will not be under our control and accordingly will not be subject to this Privacy Policy and Bizly will have no responsibility or liability to you for a Supplier&rsquo;s use of any information you provide to such Supplier.</span></p>
					<p ><span > &bull; Question of Harm. We may reveal your Personally Identifiable Information to attorneys, private investigator organizations or law enforcement agencies if we believe (a) that you are at risk of harm from another, or (b) that you are harming or interfering (or will harm or interfere) with others or violating (either intentionally or unintentionally) our Terms of Use or otherwise violating legal rights.</span></p>
					<p ><span > &bull; Legal. Bizly will reveal your Personally Identifiable Information to the extent we reasonably believe we are required to do so by law. If we receive legal process calling for the disclosure of your Personally Identifiable Information we will attempt to notify you via the email address you supplied during registration within a reasonable amount of time before we respond to the request, unless such notification is not permitted.</span></p>
					<p ><span > &bull; Transfer of Site. Bizly shall be entitled to transfer to a third party information it collects, including any Personally Identifiable Information, in connection with a sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the business entity responsible for the information under this Privacy Policy, provided the acquiring third party has agreed to safeguard your Personally Identifiable Information with protections that in all material respects are the same as or more protective than those set out in this Privacy Policy.</span></p>
					<p ><span > &bull; Retention of Personally Identifiable Information. Our policy with regard to retention of Personally Identifiable Information is dependent upon whether you are a Site Visitor or a Registered User. If you are a Site Visitor, we will only retain Personally Identifiable Information that you have provided for as long as necessary to address the purpose for which you submitted the information. If you are a Registered User, we will retain your Personally Identifiable Information for as long as you continue to be a Registered User, unless you request that we delete the information in accordance with Section 8.3 (Deleting Information).</span></p>
					<p ><span > &bull; Changing or Removing Information; Opting Out.</span></p>
					<p ><span > &bull; Account Information. To allow appropriate control over Personally Identifiable Information, you can view, change or update information that you have previously submitted either by emailing us at the e-mail address listed in Section 19 (Contact Us) below or accessing your account if you are a Registered User.</span></p>

If we choose to send you bulletins, updates, or other marketing-related materials, we will provide you with the ability to decline &mdash; or &ldquo;opt out&rdquo; of &ndash; receiving such communications. Instructions for opting-out will be provided if and when we determine to send you such a communication. Please understand that you will not be allowed to &ldquo;opt out&rdquo; of formal notices concerning operation of our Application, your participation in our Services, and legal and other related notices concerning your relationship to Bizly.</span></p>
					<p ><span > &bull; Deleting Information. Finally, if you request, we will remove your name and all other Personally Identifiable Information from our databases. Please understand, however, that it may be impossible to remove this information completely, due to backups and records of deletions. In addition, please understand that, if you request deletion of your information, you will be unable to utilize associated features of the Application and any associated Services. You may not remove de-identified, anonymous, or aggregate data from our databases.</span></p>
					<p ><span > &bull; Third Party Personally Identifiable Information. To the extent that you provide Bizly with the Personally Identifiable Information of third parties, you represent and warrant that you have permission from such third parties to provide us with their Personally Identifiable Information so that we may provide our Application and our Services.</span></p>
					<p ><span > &bull; Security. We have put in place security systems designed to prevent unauthorized access to or disclosure of Personally Identifiable Information you provide to us, and we take reasonable steps to secure and safeguard this Information. Our security systems are therefore structured to deter and prevent hackers and others from accessing information you provide to us. Please understand, though, that this information should not be construed in any way as giving business, legal, or other advice, or warranting as fail proof, the security of information provided by or submitted to Bizly. Our Security Safeguards are not fail-proof and, due to the nature of Internet communications and evolving technologies, we cannot provide, and disclaim, assurance that the information you provide us will remain free from loss, misuse, or alteration by third parties who, despite our efforts, obtain unauthorized access.</span></p>
					<p ><span > &bull; Notice of Security Incident. If we detect, despite the safeguards set out above, an intrusion or other unauthorized access to or use of Personally Identifiable Information (an &ldquo;Intrusion&rdquo;), we will (i) notify affected users of the Intrusion if the information at issue is sensitive, in our discretion, (ii) deliver this notice by the means we deem most efficient under the circumstances (such as, for example, first class mail or email); (iii) use contact information for each affected user that is current in our files; and (iv) use commercially reasonable efforts to accomplish these steps and effect this notice in a timely manner. To the extent applicable law requires steps in addition to those specified above, we will under all circumstances comply with applicable law.</span></p>
					<p ><span > &bull; Notice to California Residents: If you are a California resident, California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits you to request information regarding the disclosure of your personal information by Bizly to third parties for the third parties&rsquo; direct marketing purposes. With respect to these entities, this privacy policy applies only to their activities within the State of California. To make such a request, please contact us as provided in Section 19 (Contact Us).</span></p>

					<p ><span > &bull; Our Affiliates. We may choose to rely on and share information with other companies closely related to us &ndash; our &ldquo;Affiliates&rdquo; &mdash; for certain purposes under this Privacy Policy. By &ldquo;Affiliate,&rdquo; we mean an entity that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with Bizly, whether the control results from equity ownership, contract, overlapping management or otherwise. In this context, &ldquo;control&rdquo; means the ability to replace the officers or directors or otherwise materially influence or control management decisions. You agree that Bizly Affiliates will be entitled to enjoy our rights under this Privacy Policy and, in exchange, we agree that we will be responsible for our Affiliate&rsquo;s conduct under this Privacy Policy, if our Affiliate fails to comply with any resulting obligations. In any event, we ensure that our Affiliates agree to protect Personally Identifiable Information in a manner no less protective of your interests than the protections set out in this Privacy Policy.</span></p>
					<p ><span > &bull; Relationship to Terms of Use and Other Contracts. This Privacy Policy must be read in conjunction with our Terms of Use, and the provisions of our Terms of Use are incorporated herein. To the extent the Terms of Use conflict with the terms of this Privacy Policy, the terms of this Privacy Policy will control.
